### Approach Outline: Predicting the phase of code that is more likely to be error-prone or risky

### Features Considered Relevant:
Code Snippets: Input sequences representing code snippets extracted from software projects, Q&A forums, and websites
Expected Outputs: Corresponding error types or defect labels associated with each code snippet.

### Algorithm/Model Selection:
## LSTM-Based Neural Network:
Utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for sequence modeling.
Embedding layers for token representation.
Cross-entropy Loss for multi-class classification.
Adam optimizer for efficient parameter updates.

### Data Preparation:
1. Tokenization:
Breaking down code snippets into individual tokens. 
2. Label Encoding:
Assigning numerical labels to error types for supervised learning.
3. Word Embedding and Padding:
Mapping tokens to continuous vectors using embedding layers.
Padding sequences to a fixed length for consistent input size.

### Model Training:
